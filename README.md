ORB-SLAM2 is a real-time SLAM library for **Monocular**, **Stereo** and **RGB-D** cameras that computes the camera trajectory and a sparse 3D reconstruction (in the stereo and RGB-D case with true scale). It is able to detect loops and relocalize the camera in real time. Please check [here for the Original Implementation](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2)

# Build

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2.git ORB_SLAM2
```

We provide a script `build.sh` to build the *Thirdparty* libraries and *ORB-SLAM2*. For **Pangolin** and **AprilTags** installation, turn to `install_apriltags.sh` and `install_pangolin.sh` please. Execute:
```
cd ORB_SLAM2

./install_apriltags.sh
./install_pangolin.sh

chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```

This will create **libORB_SLAM2.so**  at *lib* folder and the executables **rgbd_tum** and **stereo_kitti** in *Examples* folder.

# Multi-agents Examples

## (Stereo) KITTI Dataset

1. Download the dataset (grayscale images) from http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_odometry.php 

2. Execute the following command. Change `KITTIX.yaml`to KITTI00-02.yaml, KITTI03.yaml or KITTI04-12.yaml for sequence 0 to 2, 3, and 4 to 12 respectively. Change `PATH_TO_DATASET_FOLDER` to the uncompressed dataset folder. Change `SEQUENCE_NUMBER` to 00, 01, 02,.., 11. 
```
./Examples/Stereo/stereo_kitti Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt Examples/Stereo/KITTIX.yaml PATH_TO_DATASET_FOLDER/dataset/sequences/SEQUENCE_NUMBER
```

### Sample data sequence
We included a sample data sequence out of box under folder `datasets`, this sample is cut out from sequence 00 of KITTI odometry dataset. Unzip file `kitti_odometry_00.zip` into `dataset/kitti_odometry_00` and execute `run_kitti.sh`, then you can find the system running on the sample sequence.

## (RGBD) TUM Dataset

1. Download a sequence from http://vision.in.tum.de/data/datasets/rgbd-dataset/download and uncompress it.

2. Associate RGB images and depth images using the python script [associate.py](http://vision.in.tum.de/data/datasets/rgbd-dataset/tools). We already provide associations for some of the sequences in *Examples/RGB-D/associations/*. You can generate your own associations file executing:

  ```
  python associate.py PATH_TO_SEQUENCE/rgb.txt PATH_TO_SEQUENCE/depth.txt > associations.txt
  ```

3. Execute the following command. Change `TUMX.yaml` to TUM1.yaml,TUM2.yaml or TUM3.yaml for freiburg1, freiburg2 and freiburg3 sequences respectively. Change `PATH_TO_SEQUENCE_FOLDER`to the uncompressed sequence folder. Change `ASSOCIATIONS_FILE` to the path to the corresponding associations file.

  ```
  ./Examples/RGB-D/rgbd_tum Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt Examples/RGB-D/TUMX.yaml PATH_TO_SEQUENCE_FOLDER ASSOCIATIONS_FILE
  ```
### Sample data sequence
We included a sample data sequence out of box under folder `datasets`, this sample is cut out from sequence 00 of KITTI odometry dataset. Unzip file `EECSBlue.zip` into `dataset/EECSBlue`, `EECSOrange.zip` into `dataset/EECSOrange` and execute `run_eecs.sh`, then you can find the system running on the sample sequence. The final cloud view shows convisibility constraints in green lines and April tags constraint in red lines.

## Processing your own sequences
You will need to create a settings file with the calibration of your camera. See the settings file provided for the TUM and KITTI datasets for monocular, stereo and RGB-D cameras. We use the calibration model of OpenCV, and you can do calibration with ROS calibration package or MATLAB Calibration App. RGB-D input must be synchronized and depth registered. Specifically for Intel Realsense Camera data bag, we provide [Python scripts](https://github.com/um-mobrob-t12-w19/ORB_SLAM2/tree/master/Examples/RGB-D/utils) to convert the data bag to TUM dataset format.

# SLAM and Localization Modes
You can change between the *SLAM* and *Localization mode* using the GUI of the map viewer.

### SLAM Mode
This is the default mode. The system runs in parallal three threads: Tracking, Local Mapping and Loop Closing. The system localizes the camera, builds new map and tries to close loops.

### Localization Mode
This mode can be used when you have a good map of your working area. In this mode the Local Mapping and Loop Closing are deactivated. The system localizes the camera in the map (which is no longer updated), using relocalization if needed.
